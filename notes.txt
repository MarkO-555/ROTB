 Notes
-------

Sound effects in the game are quite a bit louder than the title music so take care with headphones!


Keyboard control:
Left & right arrow keys to rotate, space bar to fire.

Joystick control (RH):
Point & shoot

Debug keys:
1 - Change background colours
2 - Show raster position
3 - Warp

Please note the game is tuned for a Dragon at 50Hz and is broken at 60Hz.
60Hz/CoCo support is planned for a future release. (When I figure out how!)
